I am intrigued by the functional connectivity and coordination between the neocortex and the hippocampus, as they play crucial roles in orchestrating a multitude of cognitive processes, including decision-making and memory consolidation. I believe this investigation shall shed light on the intricate interplay between different brain regions and serve as a proactive exploration of  more complex phenomenon such as consciousness.
