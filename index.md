I’m a master’s student majoring in computer science at UCSD. I received my Bachelor of Science in Intelligence Science and Technology at Sun Yat-sen University in 2020.

I’m interested in the algorithms of the brain in decision-making tasks, i.e. how neurons generate representations and process information guided by basic computational principles. I study at the intersection of artificial intelligence and neuroscience to use models in AI to better understand brain’s processes and develop novel brain-inspired AI algorithms.
